		question: "What is fetal movement/baby kicks?",
		answer:
			"Feeling baby move inside your womb is very important and new experience. Baby start kicking around 16-18 weeks into the pregnancy. Early movements are typically felt low in the abdomen and described as something similar to a flutter . It may feel like a wave or even a fish swimming. For some, the movement can feel similar to gas or hunger pangs, which can make it tricky to initially identify as kicks.",

	{
		question: "How to count your Baby’s kick?",
		answer:
			"Choose a time when you are least distracted or when you typically feel your baby move. Lie down or sit comfortably. Keep the clock with you while placing your hands on your belly. Start a timer, start counting the baby’s kicks/movements. Once you reach 10 kicks, jot down how many minutes it took.",

	{
		question: "How many fetal kicks is normal?",
		answer:
			"10 movements of any kind in an hour or less is normal, though sometimes it will take longer. If you haven't felt 10 movements within an hour: Have a snack or some fruit juice, lie down and continue counting. If it takes more than two hours to reach 10, contact your practitioner. Although the absence of activity doesn’t necessarily mean something’s wrong, it can occasionally be a red flag that needs evaluation or monitoring.",
